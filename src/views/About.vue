      <h2>The Story behind Algorithms Visualizer</h2>

        <p>
          I enjoy learning algorithms. I think it keeps my brain sharp and
          prepare me for future technical interviews. However, learning a new
          concept can be challenging and I had to go through a lot of books and
          youtube videos to really understand some algorithms. I noticed that
          following the algorithm step by step is a big help towards
          understanding them. Therefore I really appreciate the visualization of
          algorithms.
          <br />
          There are a lot of algorithms visualizer out there. However a lot of
          them looked really intimidating with a lot of buttons and inputs and
          stuffs. I find them not quite user friendly especially for beginners
          who want to touch that specific concept. Thus, I created this project
          with a simple and minimalistic design, so that user donâ€™t need to
          learn how to use the site before jumping into the algorithms.
          <br />
          Furthermore, this project also force me to learn more and practice my
          front-end development skills.

      <h2>Development Process</h2>

        <p>
          The development of this project begin with prototyping followed by
          design, which both are done using Figma. These two components can be
          seen in the picture shown in this section.
          <br />
          The framework used for this website is Vue.js mainly because of my
          preference of it over React or Angular.
          <br />
          This web app will be deployed in Heroku using Express.js.
